# Code Kata Fifteen -- A Diversion
Some sequences just keep turning up.

## A Diversion
At my son's karate school, they spend most of their time doing various exercises, with the occasional round of sparring thrown in. But every now and then the teacher finds a way to break the routine by injecting some kind of game or surprise into the mix. This kata is one of those. It's nothing serious, and unlikely to have practical benefits (unless you're working in some fairly specialized areas).
Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0's and 1's. How many n-digit binary numbers are there that don't have two adjacent 1 bits? For example, for three-digit numbers, five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?

Having worked out the pattern, there's a second part to the question: can you prove why that relationship exists?

I'm trying to track down a definitive source for this relationship: if anyone has a reference I'd love to see it. Thanks...
